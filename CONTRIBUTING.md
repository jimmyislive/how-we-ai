# Contributing to How We AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **How We AI** 🙌

This project collects **real-world, practical examples of how people actually use AI** in their work and lives. Contributions are made via **GitHub Pull Requests**, using simple Markdown files.

## What We’re Looking For

We welcome contributions that are:

- ✅ Real and experience-based  
- ✅ Practical and specific  
- ✅ Written in plain language  
- ✅ Useful to someone else  

Great examples include:
- Using AI to debug production issues
- Applying AI in leadership or people management
- Helping kids learn or study
- Creative workflows (writing, art, music)
- Health, fitness, or personal productivity
- Things that *didn’t* work as expected

## What This Is *Not*

Please do **not** submit:

- ❌ Marketing or promotional content  
- ❌ Tool documentation or tutorials  
- ❌ Pure prompt dumps without context  
- ❌ Theoretical essays with no real usage  
- ❌ Anything containing proprietary, confidential, or personal data  

## How to Contribute

- Fork the [Repository](https://github.com/jimmyislive/how-we-ai)
- Create a New Markdown File in the `_posts` directory. The file should have the format `YYYY-MM-DD-<your-slug>.md`. The site is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and uses the [minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/) theme. 
- Copy the template below and fill it out
- Commit and open a **Pull Request**
- Maintainer reviews for clarity & fit (not content policing)
- Once merged, the site is auto updated via [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

## Markdown File Format

Every submission should follow this structure (also available in `template.md`).

```markdown

## Overview

*NOTE*: The structure here is a suggestion. If you want to use different heading / formats etc, go ahead !

Describe the real problem you were trying to solve.
Be specific and grounded in reality.

> Example: I wanted to gather use cases for how people use AI in their daily lives and workflows.

## How We Used AI

Explain **exactly** how AI fit into your workflow.

- Where did AI enter the process?
- What inputs did you give it?
- What did you trust it with vs double‑check?

## What Didn’t Work (or Felt Risky)

Honesty matters here.

* Wrong answers
* Overconfidence
* Hallucinations
* Security concerns

## Key Takeaways

Quantify if possible.

* Time saved
* Fewer errors
* Better decisions
* New capability unlocked

## Conclusion

Yes / No / With caveats — and why.

```

## Writing Guidelines

- **Length:** 400–1,200 words is ideal
- **Voice:** First‑person preferred
- **Tone:** Practical, reflective, non‑salesy
- **Anonymity:** Allowed (just say so)
- **Sensitive data:** Never include secrets, PII, or proprietary code

## Review Criteria (Lightweight)

PRs are accepted if they are:

* Real and specific
* Clearly written
* Non‑promotional
* Useful to someone else

We do **not** judge:

* Seniority
* Tools used
* Writing polish
