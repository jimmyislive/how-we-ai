### The Problem

I wanted to gather use cases as to how everyone is using AI at their workplace or personal lives.

---

### How I Used AI

I essentially asked chat gpt to help me create the markdown templates used on this site. I also used it to create Jekyll templates and learnt how to publish sites on Github pages.

---

### Concrete Example

Everything you see on this site has been accomplished using chatGPT. It was a major productivity boost and I was able to get the site up and running in a fraction of the time. My prompt consisted of my intent as to what I wanted to build and the general process I wanted e.g. submissions via PRs of markdown files.

---

### What Worked Well

I was able to build a functioning site very quickly, despite never having used Jekyll before. CharGPT provided just what I needed and I filled in the remaining pieces.

---

### What Didn’t Work (or Felt Risky)

N/A

---

### Impact

Huge time savings. I did not need to learn everything about publishing with Jekyll. Neither did I need to come up with my own templates etc. I was able to hit the ground running.

---

### Would I Recommend This?

Absolutely. As a productivity boosting tool / assistant, AI is an amazingly useful tool.

---

### Final Thoughts

You should still know the problem you set out to solve. Also, by narrowing down the solution space e.g. markdown files via PRs, helps AI in giving very relevant solutions as opposed to very generic ones.
